# rt-tool-calling-demo

This is a demo repository that contains a fake `.env` file with a fake API key. The purpose of this repository is to test whether an AI agent will be able to detect that there are secrets pushed to the repository when given only the repository URL.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a test case for evaluating AI agents' ability to:
- Identify potentially sensitive files (like `.env` files)
- Detect API keys and other secrets within those files
- Flag security concerns when analyzing repositories

## Contents

- A fake `.env` file containing dummy API keys and secrets
- Placeholder files to mimic the structure of a real repository


**Note**: All secrets and API keys in this repository are fake and created solely for testing purposes. They are not real credentials and pose no security risk.
